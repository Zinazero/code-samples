# Code Samples - Data Center Module

This repository contains selected code samples from Cobalt Axis, a commercial scheduling and compliance platform I developed for operations-heavy environments. These samples demonstrate production-quality code with emphasis on reliability, security and robust data handling—principles that align closely with AI safety engineering.

> **Note**: These files are for **portfolio and review purposes only** and are not intended to run standalone.

## Technical Architecture & Safety Considerations

### Data Integrity & Validation
- **Robust error handling** throughout the data pipeline to prevent cascading failures
- **Type safety** and input validation to ensure data consistency
- **Defensive programming** practices that gracefully handle edge cases

### Security & Access Control
- **Secure API design** with proper authentication and authorization
- **Data sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **Principle of least privilege** in database access patterns

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Performance metrics calculation** with mathematical rigor (slope, R², rate of change)
- **Visual data representation** for quick anomaly detection
- **Scalable component architecture** designed for high-availability systems

## Advanced Engineering Implementations

### Statistical Computing Engine
- **Linear regression analysis** with least-squares method for trend prediction
- **R-squared goodness-of-fit calculations** for model validation
- **Multi-variable statistical transformations** with business logic integration

### Enterprise Database Architecture
- **Dynamic multi-database routing** across PostgreSQL instances
- **Complex access control matrices** with role-based data filtering
- **Optimized connection pooling** with automatic failover handling

### Real-Time Data Processing
- **WebSocket-driven live updates** with conflict resolution
- **Multi-stage transformation pipelines** handling complex percentage calculations
- **Performance optimization algorithms** for large dataset visualization

## Code Samples Included

### `DataContext.jsx` — Centralized Data Management
React context that implements:
- **Fault-tolerant API integration** with proper error boundaries
- **Data transformation pipelines** that maintain integrity across operations
- **State management** that prevents race conditions and ensures consistency

### `backendSamples.js` — Database Layer Security
Backend utilities featuring:
- **Parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Connection pooling** for reliable database performance
- **Error logging** and graceful degradation patterns

### `DataTable.jsx` — Reliable Data Visualization
Component architecture showcasing:
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets
- **Accessibility compliance** following WCAG guidelines
- **Dynamic highlighting algorithms** for pattern recognition

### `EmployeeGraphs.jsx` & `ClubGraphs.jsx` — Statistical Analysis
Visualization components that demonstrate:
- **Mathematical precision** in statistical calculations
- **Real-time data processing** with performance considerations
- **Victory Charts integration** with custom safety validations

## Why This Matters for AI Safety

The patterns demonstrated in this codebase directly translate to AI safety engineering:

- **Defensive Programming**: Just as this platform handles unreliable data center metrics, AI systems must gracefully handle unexpected inputs
- **Observability**: The monitoring and visualization patterns here are crucial for AI system interpretability
- **Fail-Safe Design**: The error handling and validation approaches mirror the robustness needed in AI safety systems
- **Mathematical Rigor**: The statistical calculations demonstrate the precision required for AI alignment research

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Victory Charts
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Security**: JWT authentication, parameterized queries, CORS policies
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests, integration testing (not included in samples)

## Production Experience
This platform has been deployed in production environments managing critical infrastructure, requiring:
- **99.9% uptime** requirements
- **Real-time data processing**
- **Regulatory compliance** for data handling and security
